- Hi, I’m @MennoMuller
- I'm honestly just doing this to have a place for people to review the code I write to practice
- I’m currently learning to code in Java
- I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything, but if you want to collaborate with me on something I'll consider it.
- How to reach me: I don't really know. I guess contact me on GitHub somehow?
